## Inspiration
We are big believers in learning from other peoples mistakes and wisdom. Each and every individual person learns through experience but it shouldn't have to take living 90 years to find the best way to live. That is why we created LifeHack as a community of people looking to share lessons that they have learned in their life and to be able to learn from others peoples lessons as well.

## What it does
It is simply just a cross platform app that allows you to read peoples lessons, star them, and post your own.

## How we built it
We decided to take on the challenge of learning a completely new language, framework and BaaS. The MVP app was built with Dart and Flutter which myself and my partner were completely new to. We also attempted to get it connected to Firebase which was also new for us.

## Challenges we ran into
The biggest challenge was learning everything and building the MVP at the same time.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Mostly, we are proud that this project had given us an excellent opportunity to learn the language and framework and apply it to a project at the same time. Although it does not work completely, it is progress that we are proud of and are excited to continue learning Flutter.

## What we learned
1) Dart
2) Flutter
3) Basics of Firebase
## What's next for LifeHack
Next for LifeHack is:
1) add authentication, 
2) make it scalable and connect it to firebase
3) improve the UI/UX.
